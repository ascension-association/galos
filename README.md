# Galos
Minimal OS to run a Podman container

### Overview
Inspired by projects like [CoreOS](https://github.com/coreos), [RancherOS](https://github.com/rancher/os), and [Talos Linux](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos), Galos is a minimal Linux OS powered by [gokrazy](https://github.com/gokrazy/gokrazy) that is primarily designed to run a single [Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman) container on IoT bare metal with as few executables as possible.

_Note: As you probably guessed, 'Galos' is a nod to **g**okrazy and T**alos** Linux (unless you're a Sidero Labs lawyer, in which case it's a tribute to the **Gal**Ã¡pag**os** Islands)_
